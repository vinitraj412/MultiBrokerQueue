# STRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION(File Structure)

## Load Balancer 
Designed with the help of nginx(used primarily for load balancing), the load balancer is responsible for distributing the traffic between the two servers. It is also responsible for the health check of the servers. The load balancer is configured to check the health of the servers every 5 seconds. If the server is down, the load balancer will not send any traffic to that server. The load balancer is also configured to send 50% of the traffic to server 1 and 50% of the traffic to server 2. The load balancer is configured to listen on port 80. 
All the requests are sent to the load balancer and the load balancer distributes the traffic to the servers.

## Managers
There are 3 types of managers in our application :
- Write Manager 
- 2 Read Managers 

Responsibilities of the write manager: 
the WriteManager is a class responsible for managing writes to the distributed messaging system. The responsibilities of the WriteManager include creating a new topic, registering a producer, registering a consumer, registering a broker, enqueueing a message, incrementing an offset, and receiving a heartbeat from a broker.

Specifically, the WriteManager is responsible for the following functions:

- `create_topic(topic_name)`: creates a new topic with the given `topic_name` and returns a list of partition IDs
- `list_topics()`: returns a list of topics
- `list_partitions(topic_name)`: returns a list of partition IDs for the given `topic_name`
- `register_producer(topic_name)`: registers a new producer for the given `topic_name` and returns a producer ID
- `register_consumer(topic_name, partition_id)`: registers a new consumer for the given `topic_name` and partition ID (if provided) and returns a consumer ID
- `register_broker(endpoint)`: registers a new broker with the given `endpoint` and returns a broker ID
- `enqueue(producer_id, partition_id, message)`: enqueues a message with the given message to the given `partition_id` for the producer with the given `producer_id`. When no `partition_id` is provided, the message should be enqueued to a random partition.
- `inc_offset(topic_name, consumer_id)`: increments the offset for the given `topic_name` and `consumer_id`
- `receive_heartbeat(broker_id)`: receives a heartbeat from the broker with the given `broker_id`.

Responsibilities of the read managers:

The responsibilities of the ReadManager include managing read operations for a distributed message queue system. Specifically, the ReadManager is responsible for the following:

- `list_topics()` - This method should return a list of available topics.
- `list_partitions(topic_name)` - This method should return the partitions available for a given `topic_name`.
- `register_consumer(topic, partition_id)`- This method should register a consumer for the given topic and `partition_id`.
- `dequeue(topic_name, consumer_id, partition_id)` - This method should dequeue a message from the given topic, partition, and consumer. When no partition is provided, the message should be dequeued from a random partition in a round robin fashion.
- `size(consumer_id, topic_name)` - This method should return the size of the queue for the given consumer and topic.
Send a periodic heartbeat to the manager to indicate the availability of the ReadManager.

Additionally, the Flask interface includes functions to handle HTTP requests for each of the above operations. The interface provides endpoints to handle GET requests for listing topics, listing partitions, and retrieving the size of a topic for a given consumer. It also includes an endpoint for dequeuing messages via a GET request. Lastly, the interface includes a command line argument parser to allow the Flask application to be run with different configurations.

All the three managers (one write, two read) are synchronised as they are accessing databases that are automatically synchronised. 



## Database

There are four tables in the database, namely:
`BrokerMetadata` , `ConsumerMetadata`, `ProducerMetadata`, and `PartitionMetadata`

The `BrokerMetadata` table stores information about the brokers in the system and contains the following columns:
- `broker_id` - a unique identifier for the broker
- `endpoint` - the endpoint of the broker (represents the IP address and port of the broker)
- `last_heartbeat` - the last time the broker sent a heartbeat to the manager
- `status` - stores whether the broker is active or not 

The `ConsumerMetadata` table stores information about the consumers in the system and it contains the following columns:
- `consumer_id` - a unique identifier for the consumer
- `topic_name` - the topic the consumer is subscribed to
- `partition_id` - the partition the consumer is subscribed to (is assigned in a round-robin fashion if the consumer is subscribed to the topic as a whole and not to a specific partition)
- `offset` - the offset of the consumer

The `ProducerMetadata` table stores information about the Producers and it contains the following columns:
- `producer_id` - a unique identifier for the producer
- `topic_name` - the topic the producer is producing to

The `PartitionMetadata` table stores data about the partitioning the topics in system and it contains the following columns:
- `id` - a unique identifier for the partition
- `topic_name` - the name of the topic
- `partition_id` - the partition ID of the topic (0, 1, 2, ...)
- `broker_id` - the broker ID of the broker that is hosting the partition
- `size` - the size of the partition  

## Broker 
From the original design which consisted of four models, the current design choice has reduced the number of models to two, namely:

- Topic_Names
    - contains: topic_name, partition_id, {supports CreateTopic, ListTopic, CheckTopic}

-TopicMessages
	contains: message_id, topic_name, producer_id, message {supports enqueue, dequeue, size}
